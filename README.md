*For the best experience, delete the file named "gacha_save.json" before opening on your computer. Alternatively, run "cheats.py" first to delete save data.*

# Welcome to the Gemini Gacha game!
This is an early-access gacha game made in python, by Doctor Charlotte-Mae!

Updates won't be regular, as I work as a consultant full time. Please understand... ^_^

# How to use the files
## main.py
"main.py" is the main file of the game. All you need to do is run on your terminal, `python main.py` (make sure you have python installed!) and the game will start!

*Note: on first run, a file named "gacha_save.json" will be created. **DO NOT DELETE THIS!** You will lose all of your progress if you delete this!*

---
## bosses.py
"bosses.py" holds the code for the boss battles. You do not need to open this as it is tied into the main script.

---
## shop.py
"shop.py" holds the code for the shop area. You do not need to open this as it is tied into the main script.

---
## cheats.py
"cheats.py" is a debugging tool that can do various fun things:
1. Erase Save (Reset All)
    - This erases all of your data, which is the same as deleting the "gacha_save.json" file. **BEWARE: THERE IS NO CONFIRMATION FOR THIS OPTION, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
2. 10 Pull
    - This pulls 10 cards for free. **This does not count towards the pity system.**
3. Add 1000 Shards
    - This adds 1000 shards for free.
4. Add 1000 Coins
    - This adds 1000 coins for free.
5. Exit
    - This terminates the cheat menu.

**I highly recommend you SAVE YOUR "gacha_save.json" BEFORE USING THIS MENU. I will not be held responsible for any loss of/corruption of data.
